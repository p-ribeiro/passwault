# Passwault

This is Passwault. A command-line tool where you can save passwords to databases, generate secure passwords and encode your password into an image.

## Why?

I needed a better way to manage my passwords without relying on third-party software, so I'm developing Passwault. This tool saves passwords in a local database, with plans to expand to secure cloud storage. Additionally, it integrates a steganography project to encode passwords into images by embedding them in the image bytes for enhanced security
